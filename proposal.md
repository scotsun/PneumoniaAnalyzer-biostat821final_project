*Topic*: a simple software tool that can parse a chest x-ray image and mark the inflammation place if detecting any

*Team member*: Scott Sun
## Introduction
The project will be developing a simple software that implement some object detection model. The software can detect and mark inflammation spots for a given chest x-ray image.

## Basic functionalities
1. Developing some simple object detection model (YOLOv3)
2. Using MongoDB as the database to store images and image annotations
3. Using Tkinter to create a simple UI
